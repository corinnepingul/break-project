# break-project
- What is the goal of the project?
  - The goal of this project is to create a website where you can keep track of all possible outfits you can make with your wardrobe and organize them by season/category
- Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?
  - My friend and I were going through her closet to get rid of clothes and try to figure out what she could still use and pair with other things
  - The next day she realized she couldn't remember anything we'd come up with, so this is for her and maybe some other people would get some use of it too
- What are your personal learning goals?
  - I want to solidify my understanding of relational databases
  - I would like to use our new understanding of JS/Jquery/Ajax to make the user experience more fluid than in some of our other db projects
- What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
  - I will be doing TDD using Rspec
  - Ruby, Rails, MySQL backend and middleware
  - JS/JqueryBootstrap, HTML, and CSS for frontend
  - Tools: Trello, ERD, Pry, Better Errors
- What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
  - Understanding relational databases
  - Understanding authentication and authorization
  - Sticking to TDD to catch errors that may arise as I add functionality
